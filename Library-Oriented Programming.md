# [fit] **Complexity**

^ Complexity is the opposite of simplicity. Something simple is as decoupled as possible.

---

# Coupling is harder **across libraries**

^ You can't couple to libraries' implementation details, for example.

^ Creating libraries as frequently as possible.

# When to decompose

^ When is the right time to split out a library/framework?

---

# One library per abstraction

---

# Library

# Framework

^ In the design sense, not the Cocoa/Apple toolchain sense
