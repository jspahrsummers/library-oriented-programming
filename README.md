# Library-Oriented Programming

At WWDC, you might’ve learned about [Protocol-Oriented Programming](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=408), a powerful way of separating concerns using protocols for abstraction.

Abstraction is awesome, and protocols especially! But whenever we throw all of our abstractions into a single codebase, it’s easy for them to become tightly coupled—intentionally or not.

_Library-oriented programming_ is a great solution to this problem. This talk will explain what “library-oriented” means, and how libraries (and frameworks) help reduce coupling, then offer some design guidelines for building simple, extensible, and nicely-abstracted libraries of your own.
