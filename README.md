# Library-Oriented Programming

Abstraction is a beautiful thing, and easier than ever with Swift. But when we throw _all_ of our abstractions straight into one codebase—our app’s—it’s very easy for them to become tightly coupled.

_Library-oriented programming_ is a solution for this problem. By creating one library per abstraction, we’ll end up with components that are simpler, encapsulated better, and more maintainable.

This talk will explain exactly what “library-oriented” means, how libraries and frameworks reduce coupling, and when the _right time_ is to build a new library. Finally, we’ll cover some specifics for creating all these new projects, from API design, to dependency management, to ensuring that each one succeeds in its own right.
